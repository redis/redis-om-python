## Getting Started

Redis OM Python is an object mapping library for Redis that provides declarative models built on Pydantic. Before contributing, please:

1. Read the [README.md](README.md) to understand the project
2. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python/pulls)
3. Review this contributing guide thoroughly

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher (we test on 3.8-3.13)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
- Docker and Docker Compose for running Redis
- Make (for running development commands)

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/redis-om-python.git
   cd redis-om-python
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   This will use Poetry to install all dependencies in a virtual environment.

3. **Start Redis containers:**

   ```bash
   make redis
   ```

   This starts two Redis instances:
   - Redis Stack (port 6380) - includes RediSearch and RedisJSON modules
   - Redis OSS (port 6381) - standard Redis for compatibility testing

4. **Enter the Poetry shell (optional):**

   ```bash
   make shell
   ```

## Project Architecture

### ï¿½ Critical: Dual Async/Sync Architecture

This project uses a unique dual-codebase approach:

- **`/aredis_om/`** - The PRIMARY source code (async implementation)
- **`/redis_om/`** - GENERATED sync version (DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY)
- **`/tests/`** - Async tests
- **`/tests_sync/`** - GENERATED sync tests

**IMPORTANT:**

- Always implement features in `/aredis_om/` first
- Never directly edit files in `/redis_om/` or `/tests_sync/`
- After making changes, run `make sync` to generate the sync versions

### Key Components

- **Models**: `HashModel` (Redis Hashes) and `JsonModel` (RedisJSON documents)
- **Query System**: Expression-based queries with Django ORM-like syntax
- **Field System**: Pydantic fields extended with Redis-specific features
- **Migration System**: Automatic RediSearch index management

## Development Workflow

### 1. Making Code Changes

For any new feature or bug fix:

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes in /aredis_om/ (async code)
# Edit files...

# 3. Generate sync version
make sync

# 4. Format your code
make format

# 5. Run linters
make lint

# 6. Run tests
make test
```

### 2. Common Development Commands

```bash
make install    # Install dependencies
make redis      # Start Redis containers
make sync       # Generate sync code from async
make format     # Format code with black and isort
make lint       # Run all linters (flake8, mypy, bandit)
make test       # Run full test suite against Redis Stack
make test_oss   # Run tests against OSS Redis
make clean      # Remove generated files and containers
make all        # Run lint, format, and test
```

### 3. Development Cycle Example

Here's a typical development cycle for adding a new feature:

```bash
# 1. Start Redis
make redis

# 2. Create your feature in /aredis_om/
vim aredis_om/model/model.py

# 3. Generate sync version
make sync

# 4. Write tests in /tests/
vim tests/test_your_feature.py

# 5. Run tests iteratively
poetry run pytest tests/test_your_feature.py -vv

# 6. Format and lint
make format
make lint

# 7. Run full test suite
make test
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_hash_model.py -vv

# Run specific test
poetry run pytest tests/test_hash_model.py::test_saves_model -vv

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=aredis_om --cov=redis_om --cov-report=term-missing

# Run tests in parallel
poetry run pytest -n auto

# Test against OSS Redis (without modules)
make test_oss
```

### Writing Tests

1. Write async tests in `/tests/`
2. Use fixtures from `conftest.py` for Redis connections
3. Mark module-dependent tests appropriately:

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_json_model_feature():
       # Test requiring RedisJSON
       pass
   ```

4. Ensure tests work with both Redis Stack and OSS Redis where applicable

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. New features should include comprehensive tests covering:

- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Both async and sync versions (sync tests are auto-generated)

## Code Style

### Formatting and Linting

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **black** - Code formatting
- **isort** - Import sorting
- **flake8** - Style guide enforcement
- **mypy** - Static type checking
- **bandit** - Security linting

Run all checks with:

```bash
make format  # Auto-format code
make lint    # Check for issues
```

### Style Guidelines

1. **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all function signatures
2. **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to public methods and classes
3. **Async First**: Implement in async (`/aredis_om/`) first
4. **Pydantic Models**: Leverage Pydantic's validation features
5. **Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import Field
from aredis_om import HashModel

class Customer(HashModel):
    """A customer model stored as a Redis Hash."""

    first_name: str = Field(index=True)
    last_name: str = Field(index=True)
    email: str = Field(index=True)
    age: int = Field(index=True, ge=0, le=120)

    class Meta:
        database = get_redis_connection()
```
